Quick Thing for those who try to SQL inject forms based the same way they Sql inject in a url. 
Some differences. 
 
1.When doing a url based attack to not alter the querty causing it to change before it has run its normal course. 
 
Described in better detail. 
 
Ex: id=15, dont go deleteing the 15 and throwing in a single quote it can cause issues. When i write the article ill explain how and why. Anyways 
 you would want to plug it in as id=15' 
 
2.Obvious injection points to look for is most places with an equal sign. 
 
3.Unlike a forms based injection where you keep the ' for your injections you wont be doing that for the url based. 
 
Yes for the intail testing you want to plug it in but for a valid query you want to keep the process flowing so 
 
when you do your injection it would be id=15 union blah blah blah. 
 
4.Common mistake of not url encoding charactors. Granted is varies upon what server is running back end. Your going to 
 
want to url endcode. 
 
ex: blind injection test id=15plussign1 to see if you get the id page of 16. You want 15 percentsign2b which is the plus sign 
 
url encoded. Do the same of other special chars if you want them to be read in correctly. 
 
Another injection worth mentioning that i left out of the last article is; Union all select table_name from information_schema.tables-- 
 
Information_schema is a list of all tables within a a database it is found in some but not all sql servers. MS sql and mysql 
 
being two of them. Now this wont always for as sometimes you as a user need certain privledges to access these tables. You can 
 
do the same to get all the column names by do the same injection only doing so with union all select column_name from 
 
information_schema.columns. Now this sort of thing is not limit to just information_schema. Below are listed some tables and 
 
other things with which you can gather the same information but diffrent SQL versions. Im not going to list each command to 
 
get these contents due to the fact im hoping you actully know some SQL and arnt just reading these and going of skid. 
 
One thing you just understand is that even on the same server your syntax for getting these things to work can be diffrent. 
 
For instance i have found that the syntax for one particular url based injection was id='10 and so on. This was a bit diffrent 
 
due to the fact it goes against the general rule not to interupt the natural flow by placing the ' before the valid value. 
 
Generally this isnt how it goes but you never know. There always a bit of testing involved by with some effort,logic and 
 
knowlege of how sites are programmed in general you will get it right.
