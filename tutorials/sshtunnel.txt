SSH Tunneling - Setting up a SOCKS proxy.

This tutorial is aimed at people with secure shell access who want to use this ssh connection to setup a reliable SOCKS4.
This doesn't matter on UID or anything, can be limited, root.. whatever as long as it's an SSH connection to the server.

WHAT YOU WILL NEED

SSH access on a server.
PuTTy

Start up PuTTy and type in the connection info. Hostname and port as usual.

Once that is done, don't start the connection. Look down the menu on the left hand side, and click on SSH then inside: Tunnels

Now underneath the box destination, tick the checkbox 'Dynamic' and leave the check box below set as Auto

Now look above and in the box called source port, type 1080. Once this is done press add.

Now connect as you would usually to this SSH server and LOGIN as normal.

Once you've logged in the socks proxy is up! the socks4 stays up as long as the ssh connection is active.

Now in the app of your choice e.g FireFox; add the socks 4 proxy. Add the hostname localhost and the port 1080.

You are now surfing securely through the servers connection rather than your own.

Enjoy.
