4.) Type Y and hit Enter to install the dependencies. 

5.) Now we need to download the source.

<b>wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/ophcrack/ophcrack-3.0.1.tar.bz2</b>

If the version has changed just check: http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/download.php

6.) Now ophcrack-3.0.1.tar.bz2 should be saved in your current directory. Lets open it up. 

<b>tar -xjvf ophcrack-3.0.1.tar.bz2</b>


7.) Now you should see a directory called ophcrack-3.0.1 . Lets move in to compile. 

 <b>cd ophcrack-3.0.1</b>
 <b>./configure</b>

*** If you get an error like this:

checking for Qt4 version of qmake... configure: error:
		ophcrack requires Qt toolkit version 4.3 or later.
		Please disable the GUI via '--disable-gui',
		or see http://www.trolltech.com/ to obtain it.

Use: sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev

and then just re-configure or if you prefer not to use the GUI 
re-configure with the option --disable-gui

8.) When it is done compiling you should see something like this.

====================================================
ophcrack has been successfully configured as follow
====================================================

 Install directory: /usr/local

 GUI: yes
 Debugging: no

====================================================

Now enter 'make' to compile
followed by 'make install' to install

9.) Now just enter the final installation commands. 

<b>make
make install
make clean
rm ../ophcrack-3.0.1.tar.bz2</b>

10.) Now you can test your installation by typing the command

11.) Now lets add it to the Gnome menu

<b>sudo mv /usr/share/app-install/desktop/ophcrack.desktop /usr/share/applications/Ophcrack.desktop
sudo mv /usr/share/app-install/icons/ophcrack.xpm /usr/share/pixmaps/ophcrack.xpm</b>

After that you can find Ophcrack in the Gnome menu under Applications -> Other.
