this script is used for visualization, to make website & ip locations visible on a common application,
google-earth. i have many ways displaying ip information in different visual forms, google earth provides
some good containers to store more information then most other solutions.

the script is easy to understand if you came as far as dictionary's with your python
learning. i use this as a module in another project with a mysql database, this is a customized version
which is easy to use and easy to customize.
if you get a hold on it there are plenty of api ports in other languages all following the same scheme.

ok here a howto on my darkKML.py my latest small script.

what it does:

the script is a constructor for .kml files (Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is an XML-based language schema for expressing geographic
annotation and visualization on existing or future Web-based, two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional Earth browsers, in our case
Google Earth)

in case you havent heard of google earth ^^

http://earth.google.com/




a nice feature of GE is that the use can create placemarks, of locations and saves them in kml as mentioned above.
To be able to create google earth latitude/longitude placemarks from ip adresses or urls, we need a database that holds the basic
information we need. some of you might have already used GeoIP from maxmind, they provide a GPL Database that does the trick for us.
this database is a .dat file, in binary format which is accessed via a python module/c module that needs to be built&installed on
the system you want the run the script on.

get the host db here :

http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz




place it somewhere on the system, preferably in the directory of darkKML.py. if you choose a different location for the .dat file be sure to adjust this line in the script:

geoDBpath = 'GeoLiteCity.dat'




and your're half way through.
next step is to get the geoip c lib's and the python class for your system.

go here:

and here:

the how-to-install is explained there + all downloadlocations are in place

alternatively on ubuntu just type:

sudo apt-get install libgeoip1 && sudo apt-get install python-geoip




so much for the setup.

the script takes a list of urls or ip adresses, gets info on very entry in the list and creates a final
kml file ready to open with google earth. acceptable file formats are.

87.65.1.99

76.43.23.6:8080
34.23.65.7:80
81.4.53.77:8181

dont mind the length of the file, i tested it up to 50.000 entries and it still works.
so all you have to do is create a simple .txt file holding alot of urls and you are ready to go.


before you create your first file take a note of 2 parameters that you may want to adjust inside the script

verbose = True




gives you console output of whats happening, this is nice.. yes as long as you have less than 20 hosts.
if you dont want the outout change True to False and its silent.

wwwcheck = True 




this is important to change if you want to check servers that are NOT webservers.
means, if you want to check your proxylist, its a bad idea to get webserver info.
this will of course remove alot on information form the final kml file and produce much smaller files.
** if you turn this option of you cut the net communication of the script, its way faster then **


python darkKML.py myiplist.txt
....
....
creates the file.kml as named by the user in the scriptdirectory, all you have to do is
double click the kml file and google earth opens up. showing you some yellow markers.
