AND/OR
STEP 3:

 
#Get a 1/2gig usb drive plug it into a windows installation with direct X 
#Copy everything in system32 or just the files 
#go back to backtrack3 
#copy all the files in system 32 into 
#/root/.wine/c_drive/windows/system32 




STEP 4: OR IGNORE AND DO SIX AND THEN FIVE

 
#Install war3 
cd /path/tocd/ 
wine install.exe 
#... this is pretty straight forward 





STEP 5:

 
#GET AWC 
http://www.freewebs.com/superbug77/AWC.rar 
#GET FREEBSD RAR COMMANDLINE 
http://www.win-rar.com/index.php?id=160&dl=rarbsd-3.7.1.tar.gz 
#DO STUFF 
tar -xvf rarbsd-3.7.1.tar.gz 
unrar e AWC.rar /root/AWC 
cd AWC 
wine AWC.exe 
#Configure LOWEST GRAPHICAL SETTINGS AND 
#Unset the option in graphics specifically mentioned for opengl 





STEP 6:

 
#Update warcraft due to the fact that warcraft tries to restart wc3 which just 
#massively fucks shit up 
#Trying to update it is a lost cause BUT WASTE YOUR TIME IF YOU WANT! 
#You might have luck with making xwindows control it....probably not 
 
# I advise you to transfer the files from and updated war3 install that are #patched 
 and copy 
#IF you skipped 4 just copy everything and you are set 
#IF you did 4 then well great 





STEP 7:

 
cd "/root/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Warcraft III" 
wine "Frozen Throne.exe" -opengl
