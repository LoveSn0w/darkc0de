To day i will explain Symlink function


first this function we used it to make shortcut for any file or folder we need

so this function will be very useful for us to read any folder or file we want

and this help us in Hacking sites as u could see safe_mode on in sometims

and u can't read files or u can see some times that Your id is user(phpsuxec)

and u can't move to the other web sites folders or reading files on the others

websites on the same server cuz ur id is phpsuxec not nobody

let's start explain this useful function

first type this cmd in the command line

ln -s /home/user/public_html/folder shortcutFolder

replace the first path with the folder w want to make shortcut of it

and then execute this cmd

and and this will make shortcut in ur current path for the folder that u typed

in the first path the u will find the shortcut with name shortcutFolder As u typed

so open this shourtcut via browser and u will see the the contains of the folder that u make a shortcut of it

but in sometimes u make shortcut of folder that have index.php or index.html

and u can't see the contains of folder cuz there is index

so u should upload .htaccess file and write in it this

DirectoryIndex seees.html

this will change the name of index in the shortcut folder

and so u can see contains in the shortcutfolder

notice that if ur id not phpsuxec u should make the folder that contains

the short cut folder with 777 perm

some servers didn't allow symlink u can write this in htaccess file

Options +FollowSymLinks

notice that u should upload.htaccess in the same folder that contain shortcut folder i mean that the shortcut folder and .htaccess file must be in the same folder

any questions i will answer it
